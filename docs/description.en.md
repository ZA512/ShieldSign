## 🛡️ ShieldSign — The simplest way to **know where you can enter your password**

Knowing if a login page is real or fake should be obvious.
Today, it's no longer the case: phishing pages have become indistinguishable to the naked eye.

**ShieldSign solves this problem.**
The extension automatically validates safe login pages and displays a clear, visible banner that's impossible to imitate.
**If ShieldSign doesn't confirm the page, don't type your password.**

## 🎯 Why is this really useful?

Because today we get tricked *not by carelessness*, but because a fake site can be **perfectly identical** to the real one.
The only important question becomes:

👉 *"Can I type my password here?"*

With ShieldSign, the answer is **visual, immediate and reliable**.

## ✨ What ShieldSign does for you

### ✔️ Automatically identifies login pages

As soon as a site contains a password field, ShieldSign checks the domain.

### ✔️ Displays an **impossible to imitate** validation banner

3 security modes:

* **Discreet badge**
* **Personal keyword** known only to you
* **Random code changing with each visit** (recommended)

An attacker **cannot reproduce** this code or keyword.
Even a perfect copy of the page will be unmasked in a second.

### ✔️ Works with lists: community, personal, enterprise

* A **community list** of trusted domains
* Your **own favorite domains**
* Enterprise option: a **list pushed by your organization**, to secure internal access

### ✔️ Automatically adds your legitimate sites

Every time you log in to a new site, ShieldSign can offer to save it.
**You have nothing to manage: the extension learns with you.**

### ✔️ 100% local, 100% private

* No data sent to a server.
* No tracking.
* The list of sites you use stays **in your browser**, only as URLs.

## 🔒 Why is it safer than an HTTPS padlock?

Because **all modern phishing sites also have a padlock**.
Because "looking at the URL" is no longer realistic: tired, rushed, stressed... humans get tricked.

ShieldSign gives you **an external visual marker**, safe, constant, reliable.

You no longer wonder:

> "Is this the right site?"
> You simply look:
> **Is the banner there? Then it's good.**
